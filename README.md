# The-Simon-Game

<small>

Simon is a classic memory-based game that challenges players to remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors (and sounds).

Each color button is associated with a distinct sound. The game tests the player’s short-term memory, attention, and reaction time.

For this game I add sound, a little bit animation and try to learn about new function such as setTimeout.

Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
